# MediaPipe Hand Tracking

Real-time hand landmark tracking using **OpenCV** and **MediaPipe**.  
This repo shows the learning path (simple → module → test), and provides a reusable `HandDetector` you can import in other projects.


## Features
- 21-point hand landmark detection (per hand)
- Reusable `HandDetector` class (draw/no-draw modes)
- FPS overlay and basic test runner
- Clean structure for future features (gestures, control)

## Quick Start
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
